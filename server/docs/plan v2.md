- Replace CSV with SQLite for expense tracking.

**Week 4: Transition to PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy**
- Set up PostgreSQL.
- Define SQLAlchemy models for `Users`, `Categories`, `Transactions`, and `Budgets`.
- Implement CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy.

**Week 5: Enhanced Features**
- Implement the `loan_type` in the `Transactions` table.
- Add functionality to track loans and reimbursements.
- Create functions to generate financial summaries and visualize data with charts.

**Week 6: User Interface and Reports**
- Develop a basic user interface to interact with the application.
- Display financial summaries and charts.
- Add user authentication and manage sessions.

### Tasks for Week 1

1. **Set Up Python Environment**:
   - Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
   - Install necessary libraries: `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`.

2. **Learn Python Basics**:
   - Review basic syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), and control flow (loops, conditionals).
   - Practice file I/O operations to read/write data from/to files.

3. **Initial Expense Tracking Script**:
   - Write a script to input expenses and save them to a CSV file.
   - Practice using Pandas to read and manipulate CSV data.

### Tasks for Week 2

1. **Extend Script for Income, Reimbursements, and Loans**:
   - Modify the script to handle different transaction types (income, expense, reimbursement, loan).
   - Add functionality to categorize transactions.

2. **Save Data in Pandas DataFrame**:
   - Store transactions in a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Implement basic reporting (total income, total expenses, net balance).

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use Matplotlib to create basic charts showing income vs. expenses.

### Tasks for Week 3

1. **Set Up SQLite Database**:
   - Create database schema in SQLite.
   - Define models for `Users`, `Categories`, and `Transactions`.

2. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - Create, read, update, and delete transactions in the database.

3. **Migrate Existing Data**:
   - Migrate data from CSV/Pandas to SQLite.

### Tasks for Week 4

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Install and configure PostgreSQL.
   - Create a new database for the project.

2. **Define SQLAlchemy Models**:
   - Define SQLAlchemy models and create tables in PostgreSQL.

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement functions to handle transactions in PostgreSQL.

### Tasks for Week 5

1. **Implement Loans and Reimbursements**:
   - Extend the `Transactions` table to include `loan_type` and `related_transaction_id`.
   - Implement functionality to track money lent to others and reimbursements.

2. **Financial Summaries**:
   - Create functions to generate weekly, monthly, and yearly financial summaries.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Use Matplotlib to create charts showing financial summaries.

### Tasks for Week 6

1. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a basic UI to interact with the application.
   - Display financial summaries and charts.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Manage user sessions.

3. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test all features and refine the application.
   - Ensure data accuracy and usability.

By following this structured approach, you'll be able to build a comprehensive financial tracking application while progressively learning key concepts and technologies.
