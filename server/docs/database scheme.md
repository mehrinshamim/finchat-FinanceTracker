Yes, it's definitely possible to add a feature to track the money you lend to people as a separate column from expenses. To accommodate this, you can introduce a new `loan_type` column in the `Transactions` table to distinguish between personal expenses and money lent to others. Here's how you can structure it:

### Enhanced Database Schema

1. **Users Table**: Stores user information.
2. **Categories Table**: Stores categories for transactions, associated with users.
3. **Transactions Table**: Stores income, expenses, reimbursements, and loans.
4. **Budgets Table**: Stores budget information for users, linked to categories.

### Database Schema Design

- **Users Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `username`: Unique username.
  - `password_hash`: Hashed password.
  - `email`: Unique email.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of account creation.

- **Categories Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `name`: Category name.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.

- **Transactions Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `description`: Transaction description.
  - `category_id`: Foreign key referencing `Categories`.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `date`: Date of transaction.
  
  - `loan_type`: Either 'lent' or 'received' (for tracking money lent to others and money received back).
  - `related_transaction_id`: Foreign key referencing `Transactions` for tracking reimbursements.

- **Budgets Table**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `amount`: Budget amount.
  - `category_id`: Foreign key referencing `Categories`.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `start_date`: Start date of the budget period.
  - `end_date`: End date of the budget period.
